## Overview

This is the web app for the Web FFT Meta-Library. Benchmark and test your browser(s) and different FFT algorithms against one another to see what our NPM library can do for you!

## Quick Start

### Installation

First, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.

Then, clone the repository or download the code. Navigate to the root of the project in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all necessary dependencies.

### Running Locally

To start the development server and view the app in your browser, simply run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server. You can then open your browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to interact with the local web app.

Any changes you make to the source code will be reflected in real-time in the browser, thanks to Vite's hot module reloading.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Further Configuration and Expansion

The project comes with a minimal ESLint configuration to ensure code quality. For production applications, consider expanding the ESLint setup. Guidelines and suggestions for this are provided in the original template documentation.

## Testing

We encourage testing your configurations extensively before deploying them in a production environment. To run the existing test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
